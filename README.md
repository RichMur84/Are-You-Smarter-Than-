On this Module i created a mini quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
The theme is Hollywood trivia and i hope you enjoy it.

To create a mini quiz in JavaScript, you first need to set up your HTML file with the appropriate elements such as divs and forms. Next you need to create an array containing your quiz questions and their corresponding answers. You can then use JavaScript to iterate through the array and dynamically display the questions and answers on the webpage. To verify that a user selected the correct answer, you can add event listeners to the answer selection buttons and compare the selected answer to the correct answer in the array. Finally, you can count the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz. With some CSS styling, you can make your mini quiz look professional and attractive for users to interact with.
